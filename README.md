This project allows users to add movies to the website for others to download. The movies have specs, that give specifications about each of the movies like movie length, who were the actors, genre, and also the plot of the movie. Each movie also has reviews. When a new movie is created, you can also add reviews for it for other users to see. If one of the users does not like the movie, then there is also an option to delete the movie from the database. At the end when the user wants to download the movie, then all they have to do is click the download movie link to have it started. I chose to make this app purely for the love of movies. It would be nice to be able to download movies without any restrictions or having to pay for them. I made this app using react for my frontend and ruby for my back end. I was pretty comfortable writing the code for react and ruby. I would say the biggest struggle was making both the frontend and the backend communicate. I feel a bit better now, but: I feel, I still need a bit more practice on it for the future. This is my blog link for this project https://medium.com/@harrikhan20/movies-app-with-a-frontend-and-backend-c8af6daad30. This link will explain more about the details for the project. The frontend react portion was more the same as my last project but this time I added the movies from the backend of the project. I am very comfortable with the react portion of this project.
